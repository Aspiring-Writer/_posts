You know that phrase that people use when something good is going bad? For example, if you're in a great country that starts to turn into a not-so-good country, what do you say? Probably something like this country is "going south." The phrase "going south" commonly means "going bad;" however, is this phrase wrong in a way? Where does it even come from? In this post, I'm going to examine the phrase "going south" and take a different approach to it, one that begs the question of if "going south" is really bad.
